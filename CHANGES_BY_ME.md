removed "import torch" on File "whistleblower/core/whistleblower.py", line 9, 
removed "import random" ," import re" ,"from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM" lines from the same file which are of no use  lines 2,6,7
Removed those because those modules were not used anywhere and were causing unnecessary module not found errors while launching the app

updated line 11 in app.py "with open('styles.css', 'r') as file:" to "with open('ui/styles.css', 'r') as file:" to avoid filenotfound error in some systems
updated  gitignore to ignore my venv and other unnecessary .DS_Store files generated by my mac

Hope this contribution makes some sense and I'd also like an opportunity to intern with Repello-AI Please do consider me as a potential candidate for hiring 
Here is my resume :  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Dm_zSXWoqsh9xVhsVPkyyEw8diYznzpg/view?usp=sharing
